#Akka patterns

This repository contains code that demonstrates large-scale Akka applications. My aim is to share my experience & the pains so that you don't have to re-invent the wheel yourself.

The topics I shall cover include:

* Building (Maven and SBT)
* Composing features
* Testing (unit, integration and white-box), including BDD
* Data access (relational, document, key-value and graph databases)
* Transactional behaviour
* Proper application of purely functional code & patterns (Shapeless and Scalaz)
* Authentication and authorisation
* User interface
* And many more

See the [Wiki](wiki/Home) for documentation of the various patterns; and please do share your ideas!
